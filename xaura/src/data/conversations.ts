      "Here’s the full story of your June 8–19 push — 50 campaigns across 6 channels, with one clear plot line: we earned plenty of attention, but most of it slips away before it becomes revenue.\n\n" +
      "<strong>The headline</strong>\n\nWe published 1.12M messages and delivered 589K of them — about a 52.5% delivery rate. Those reached audiences produced 5,016 clicks, 590 conversions, and ₹24.3L in revenue. A strong top of funnel, but a thin bottom.\n\n" +
      "<strong>Chapter 1 — Where the audience leaks</strong>\n\nDelivery is the first crack. WhatsApp carried the volume at 510K published but only 195K landed — we lost more than 60% before a single customer saw the message, and RCS and BPN tell the same story. The bright spots are Email, which delivered all 52K it sent, and APN at 47K of 57K. The first chart below makes the gap clear.\n\n" +
      "<strong>Chapter 2 — Where attention stalls</strong>\n\nAmong the messages that did land, WhatsApp leads on engagement at a 1.41% click rate, with SMS close behind. But conversion collapses across the board — Email clicks at 0.97% yet converts just 0.02%, and BPN converts almost no one. People are clicking; the journey after the click isn’t closing.\n\n" +
      "<strong>How the story ends</strong>\n\nJune wasn’t an attention problem — it was a delivery and conversion problem. Recover WhatsApp, RCS and BPN delivery and we widen reach without spending more; tighten the post-click experience on Email and we convert traffic we already have. Two levers, both ready for the next chapter.",
